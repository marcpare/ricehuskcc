<p>My 50 lb bag of rice husk is in the mail.</p> 

<p>In Vietnam or Cambodia, you just have to go down the road to get as big of a bag of rice husk that you can carry. The mill will give it to you for free, as they have to pay to get it hauled away.</p>

<p>In the US you have to pay $50 shipping and handling to get rice husk from one of the seven rice growing states.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I needed to find some material that could approximate the properties of rice husk.</p>

<p>In earlier tests, I used wood chips as fuel. Wood chips will pack together relatively tightly, restricting air flow in a similar way to rice husk. They do have a much higher energy density, so it is easier to burn wood chips. This is a good testing fuel to make sure you've got the basics of your design working.</p>

<p>When you're ready to move on, you need something more challenge to burn. I ran into a bag of grass seeds, which looked like a promising proxy fuel for rice husk. I couldn't find any combustion data on grass seed (I suppose most people plant it, rather than burn it). The grass seed are very similar in particle size and shape to rice husk, so they will give a good indicator of air flow in the device.</p>

<p class="caption">Left: rice husk. Right: grass seed.</p>

<p>Since I don't know the energy content of grass seed, it may turn out that grass seed are harder to burn than rice husk. </p>

<p>This is a common scenario in prototyping. We are not doing scientific experiments that outright prove or disprove a hypothesis. The results of our prototyping will give us some indication of the direction to go. It requires judgement to interpret the results and move on to the next stage of prototyping.</p>

<h3>Aug 20 Trials</h3>

<p>Modified the prototype reactor based on observations of previous test.
</p>

<p>Changes made</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up inner chimney to promote air flow through center</li>
<li>Increase diameter of reactor to increase heating power</li>
<li>Tighten wind screen to prevent pyrolysis gas from escaping out the sides of the reactor</li>
</ol>

<p class="caption">Prototype used for all three tests.</p>

<p>Run 1: Wood chips to make sure the thing works and observe air flow. Bottom lit.</p>

<p>Big flames. Much more intense than previous tests. The changes have definitely improved the performance.</p>

<p>Interesting to note that we get flames both in the center and above the fuel bed. That means there's still not enough suction in that inner cylinder.</p>

<p>Run 2: Grass seed, bottom lit</p>

<p>I put two pinches of starter in the center chimney. The starter all burned up without getting the grass seed going.
</p>

<p>Run 3: Grass seed, bottom lit</p>

<p>Spread some starter in a small pile underneath the grass seed. 
</p>

<p>Grass seed gets going.</p>

<p>Burning of grass seed not nearly as intense as wood chips. Some of the flames are blue (different chemical composition of grass vs. wood).</p>

<p>Only about 50% of the grass seed are burned.</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<p>In many tests of rice husk conducted at Georgia Tech in 2010, we could not even get the rice husk started. So, despite not getting a full, intense burn of the grass seed, we are on the right track.</p>

<p>It may be easier to burn rice husk than grass seed.</p>

<p>We will find out in the next round of tests. The UPS guy just knocked on my door carrying a man-sized box.</p>
