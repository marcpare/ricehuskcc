Day 21

Today we take a break from running through test results to learn about prototyping technique.

It is easy to get the impression that a rapid prototyping process is necessarily sloppy. This is not the least bit true.

"Rapid prototyping" means that you try optimize _learning_ speed. Sometimes you can do this with sloppy prototypes. But, often, you need to invest some time on quality building in order to actually learn something from the result.

We saw this happen at Georgia Tech. The story of Isaac improving the build quality and the stove suddenly working.


A Clean Solder

All the things you have to keep in mind

- what flux
- what metals
- where's the heat?
- the flange, the shape of the join
- how to cut the hole with enough tolerance
- what dimensions are easy to find in the store
- the soldering technique



the tendency of armchair designers to neglect the details, which are the actual drivers of good design.
