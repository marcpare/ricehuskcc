<p>Creation requires rest.</p>

<p>Every seven days during this design log is dedicated to getting out in the world. Cooking things. Observing nature. Interacting with strange people.</p>

<p>It's not a waste of time, the subconscious rearranges things in the background, and providing a deep well of solutions the next day.</p>

<p>Don't succumb to the expectation to work frantically. This is for the people that imitate success, not for those that have experienced it. You are a fountainhead of solutions, rather than a tool for specific situations.</p>

<p>William James says it better&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If, namely, we wish our trains of ideation and volition to be copious and varied and effective, we must form the habit of freeing them from the inhibitive influence of reflection upon them, of egoistic preoccuptation about their results.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Say to yourself, 'I won't waste another minute on this miserable thing, and I don't care an iota whether I succeed or not.' Say this sincerely, and feel it; and go out and play, or go to bed and sleep, and I am sure the results next day will encourage you to use the method permanently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Mariela and I are going to go to the beach before Fall catches up with Seattle.</p>
