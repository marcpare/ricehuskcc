Rest

Invention and design requires rest.

You've got to get out in the world. Cook things. Observe nature. Interact with strange people.

Don't worry, your subconscious will rearrange things in the background, and you'll find yourself full of solutions the next day.

Act with the confidence that you'll find the solution, and you will. It's only a matter of time.

More important is to realize that you're a fountainhead of ideas, rather than a solver of specific problems.

"If, namely, we wish our trains of ideation and volition to be copious and varied and effective, we must form the habit of freeing them from the inhibitive influence of reflection upon them, of egoistic preoccuptation about their results."

"_Unclamp_, in a word, your intellectual and practical machinery, and let it run free; and the service it will do you will be twice as good."

"Who are the [scholars] who do recite well? Often those who are most indifferent. _Their_ ideas reel themselves out of their memory of their own accord."

"Say to yourself, 'I won't waste another minute on this miserable thing, and I don't care an iota whether I succeed or not.' Say this sincerely, and feel it; and go out and play, or go to bed and sleep, and I am sure the results next day will encourage you to use the method permanently."

I think Mariela and I are going to go to the beach before Fall catches up with Seattle.
