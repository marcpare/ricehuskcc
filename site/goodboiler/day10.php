Good Boiler Initial Concept

I'm ready to strike at a possible solution to the Good Boiler design problem.

The work so far has been organized but not directed at something in particular. I've poked and prodded at different aspects of the problem using prototypes, calculation, research, and writing.

This cloud of ideas has now come together into a solid concept.

Here is the concept

The following things convinced me to head on this path 

I've already demonstrated the heart of the design: clean, easy combustion using natural draft.

Sizing calculations suggest I can boil water with A cm X B cm batch of fuel.

It's hard to say exactly what size will be most useful to people. Families may want to boil 7 liters of water at a time for a meal or just 1 liter at a time to make a cup of tea. There is probably room both a number of different product sizes.

I'll aim at getting the 2 cup size working, since it's easier and cheaper to build the small size. If we can pull it off, it will be a proof of concept that motivates work by me or others to scale up the device.

Remember, this effort is about widespread collaboration, not high-ego design by an individual.

Up next is building a boiling test rig to see how much water can be boiled in order to verify my sizing calculation.
