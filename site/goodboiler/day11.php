<p>The most recent innovation in devices that cook using rice husk as fuel is Dr. Belonio's Cylindrical Gasifier. It demonstrates a beautiful blue flame consistently. It has very simple construction. <a href="http://www.bioenergylists.org/stovesdoc/Belonio/Belonio_gasifier.pdf">Dr. Belonio's Handbook</a>, a gem of documentation, describes in great detail the many facets of its operation.</p>

<p>Dr. Belonio's pioneering work now allows us to consider new design territory for exploration.</p>

<p>The possible areas of improvement to the Cylindrical Gasifier can make up many posts. I want to focus on one today: repeatability of burner performance.</p>

<p>The Cylindrical Gasifier produces a gas that is burned in a many-holed diffusion burner.</p>

<p>Since there is no air available by the time the pyrolysis gas reaches the top of the burner, air is supplied above the burner, from the ambient environment.</p>

<p>The air is entrained into the gas stream according to how fast the pyrolysis gas is exiting the reactor. There is not a significant amount of turbulence, so the flame takes on the characteristic tear-drop shape of a diffusion flame.</p>

Depending on how much air is entrained, I have seen the Overall Thermal Efficiency of the stove range from 20% to 35%.

This wouldn't be so bad if we had good control over the air entrainment. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to control.

Here are four thermal efficiency results from Cambodia. 

<table class="pure-table centered">
  <tr>
    <td>Run 1</td>
    <td>19.7%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run 2</td>
    <td>19.9%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run 3</td>
    <td>27.8%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run 4</td>
    <td>35.6%</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>The first two results had a gap between the pot and skirt of 2 cm.
</p>
<p>The second two results had a gap of 3 cm.
</p>
<?php echo fn_img("day11/schematic.png")?>
<p>
The small change in gap size influenced the air flow such that the amount of air entrained was different. The change in air amount dramatically affects Overall Thermal Efficiency (you can even get negative efficiency, cooling down the cooking pot, with enough air).</p>

<p>It might seem like a nitpick to point out this difference in behavior until you consider the realities of stove construction and dissemination in developing countries.
</p>
<p>How easy it is to build a stove in rural Cambodia and get the size of a cylinder to within 1cm of the design? Have you ever tried to bend and roll cylinders by hand?
</p>
<p>What if the design is being passed along by word of mouth?
</p>
<p>How can you tell that the stove is performing at high efficiency? Is there time to do testing of every stove? What if the stove performance changes over time as the materials wear out and deform?
</p>
<p>These are big questions. Each project will have a different set of answers.
</p>
<p>I think the implication for designers and engineers is that we attempt to quantify and communicate the variability in performance of our designs.
</p>

<p>
  Note, too, that it's not just this particular design that suffers from problems of reliably under variation. The following chart is from Samuel Baldwin's 1987 thesis on improved Rocket stoves. The marked points on the chart show how a change in a stove dimension of less than 8 mm can drop efficiency from 40% to 20%.

<p>It's great if our high performance design works in the lab, but what good will the design actually do for a person working in the field?
</p>
<p>Thinking about it another way, what technology would a project be more likely to choose: one that is flexible and reliable under a variety of conditions or a high-performance device that has only seen laboratory-grade fuel?
