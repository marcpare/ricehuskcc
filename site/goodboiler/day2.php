<p>My trip in Cambodia last December was prompted by a hole in a roof.
</p>

<p>Kent Good, a missionary and avid stove tinkerer, had fabricated a well-known  stove design from the Philippines and asked his neighbors to test the device for a few months.</p>

<p>His neighbor, a handy and kind Cambodian man, agreed. The rice husk that the stove used for fuel that could be acquired for free just down the road. The stove produced an attractive blue flame. It found its role in the home boiling large kettles of water for drinking and for tea.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after some months of usage, a fist-sized hole appeared in the zinc roof above the stove. None of the other stoves used in the household caused such a result. There was no doubt that this hole was cause by the combustion products of the rice hull.</p>

<p>This problem was the impetus for the project, but, after arriving in Battambang, I came to find out there was more to the picture. While his neighbor had been testing the stove, Kent had been doing some surveys in the surrounding community.</p>

<p>"People say they would like the stove to be able to cook rice," Kent told me. "And be able to fry fish, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, and it would be great if it were 30% cheaper."</p>

<p>The interesting technical details of these tasks will be the subject of a future post. For now, we've already arrived at something interesting, a common paradox in product design: trying to simultaneously increase the capabilities of a product while lowering its cost.</p>

<p>Lowering cost drives you to choose cheaper materials, use less of them, and decrease number of components in the system.</p>

<p>Increasing the capabilities of a stove requires adding subsystems (like an improved fan controller), using more durable metal, or swapping in more performant insulation.</p>

<p>How do you resolve this paradox?</p>

<p>One tack is to try to redefine the requirements of the design problem.</p>

<p>Is it really necessary that we add these capabilities? What if the product only lasted 1 month? What if it could only cook one thing? What if its high cost were a selling point (e.g. as a status symbol)?</p>

<p>At Kent's workshop, we eventually came up with,</p>

<p>"What if the stove could only boil water?"</p>

<p>The practice of pasteurizing water via boiling seemed widespread. Many used expensive charcoal to do so. With a bit of research, we discovered that UNICEF, in 2007, noted that 53% of households in Cambodia heat water to disinfect it for household drinking.</p>

<p>Bringing water to a boil is an energy-intensive operation. We estimated it taking up a large part of a household's energy budget.</p>

<p>Finally, in considering the design of a combustion device, limiting its application to bringing water to 100&deg; C greatly simplifies its design. The heating level doesn't matter as long as it's sufficient. Efficiency is not a primary concern, as it enables switching from an expensive fuel (charcoal) to a waste fuel (rice husk).</p>

<p>"But wait!", you might protest, "isn't this obvious? Isn't a hot water kettle something that's already in my kitchen?"</p>

<p>Quite right. But, as far as I am aware, such a device that uses rice husk for fuel doesn't exist yet. Since rice husk is free in many developing countries, any device that allows its use stands a good chance at improving quality of life.</p>

<p>The paradox is resolved in this case by loosening the performance requirements. We arrived there by investigating closely what people were actually doing in the kitchen, looking for opportunities to simplify the engineering problem.</p>

<p>I have left a few threads loose. What about the corrosion problem I mentioned earlier? What price point are we actually targeting? Why aren't existing designs sufficient? There's much to uncover exploring these questions over the next month.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll take a look at alternative designs and attach some numbers to the generalizations I made today.</p>
