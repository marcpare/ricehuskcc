Day 22:

Six tests. Looking for stove to burn through entire batch of fuel.

(1)
Show diagram on right side in table.
Maybe pictures in center column?
Left column:

Part of the prototype used JB Weld, but we found it caught fire.

(2) 
Complete burn. Notice flames on the inside. This surprising (and seems to work well)

(3)
Does it work removing the inner basket? No, only an inner ring of fuel is burned.

(4)
Use a tighter outside diameter. Also burns 100%

(5)
Repeat configuration in (4). It works.

(6)
Repeat configuration in (4). It works.
