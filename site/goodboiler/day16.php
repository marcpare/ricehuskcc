Presentation of batch of test results
----

The last X days, I've been running a series of trials to understand and implement the conceptual design presented on Day 10.

As is normally the case with stove testing, not everything went according to plan. In particular, we encountered fuel moisture issues that trashed over half the trials.

My goal is to boil 1/2 Liter of water with a convenient batch of rice husk.

I am exploring the space of possible combustion chamber designs so that when it comes later in the process of design, I will have options. For example, when you're trying to minimize material, it's better to have a short, fat reactor than a tall, skinny one. (up to a certain point)

I may find that I need to dial up the power of the reactor to get repeatable boiling performance. It is quite common that stoves performance at high efficiency during one run, then low efficiency during another. Since this is a batch stove, the fuel chamber would have to be sized for the low efficiency case.

**Corrosion** encountered in aluminum can used as chimney. Uncertain whether this is because of high temperature or pyrolysis products of rice husk, Swapping to thicker gauge tin can to monitor its lifetime. Kelly Kettles, which are made of aluminum, last many years using wood as fuel. Quite a few videos show smokey operation with big flames. That leads me to believe there is some particularly corrosive characteristic of the rice husk that must be considered.

So far, the initial configuration that was able to be repeated X times, failed Y times.

This has prevented exploring further geometries for the moment while the issue is sorted out.
