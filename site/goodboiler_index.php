<h1><span class="good-boiler-logo">Good Boiler</span> Design Log</h1>    

<p>In December 2012, I visited Battambang Cambodia and encountered a vexing design problem. Here is my attempt to solve it.</p>

<p>This is a 30-day design project with no guarantee of success. Even if it fails, I hope the documentation and approach will be useful for others engaged in the design of technology for the developing world.</p>

<p>Everything here is Open Source and copying is highly encouraged. Please do contact me if you're interested. I would like to hear your thoughts and ideas. If this work inspires you to build something, send me a picture.</p>
