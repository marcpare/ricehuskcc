<p>In December 2012, two missionaries welcomed me into their homes in Cambodia to see if I could help advance their improved cook stove work in and around Battambang, Cambodia.</p>

<p>These two missionaries, Kent and Becky Good, were doing extraordinary work. They could speak Khmer. They fed me the best duck soup I had had in my two years in Southeast Asia. They balanced a great many community projects in language, religion, and business.</p>

<p>I learned a great deal about the cooking conditions in rural Cambodia. We made a lot of progress improving stove designs together.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we never arrived at a final design. I have been thinking about the problem since. I have finally managed to carve out some time and resources to approach this design problem again.</p>

<p>I'm calling the device the <span class="good-boiler-logo">good boiler</span> because of their inspiration. </p>

<p>Now, one of my major principles in designing for the developing world is to try to avoid a "solutions focused" approach. Because of the enormous complexity of designing products outside of your cultural and socioecomonic frame, I believe that it is essentially impossible that your invention will "save the world." Even Norman Borlaug, who received the XX and YY for his work in plant genetics had this to say about his role in the big picture:</p>

<blockquote>I think people have chosen me as a symbol of the work of many people, etc...</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, it's difficult for your involvement with a community to not benefit it in some way. Whether it is increased awareness of their issues, knowledge exchange, or simply being an extra set of hands to help with work.</p>

<p>In that spirit, this design exercise will be both about driving at a novel technical achievement as well as a meaningful documentation effort of some of the knowledge I accrued the last two years working in rural Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I'll introduce in more detail the purpose of improved stoves in Cambodia and why this project is focused on a "Boiler".</p>
